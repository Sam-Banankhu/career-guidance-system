# CAREER GUIDANCE TOOL LEVERAGING DATA, AI/ ML AND OTHER INNOVATIVE TECHNOLOGIES.

# 1. Problem statement
Thousands of students who have been awarded a ***Malawi School Certificate of
Education*** struggle to understand the career options open to them as they have limited
access and exposure to information, opportunities and quality mentors.

# 2. Proposed solution
Develop a solution to help students know the options in front of them, make informed
choices, which they can use as a career guidance tool. This tool will help students to
predict six best possible university programs that match their skills/interest with the
needs of the industry, based on their **MSCE** grades. Our team will explore ways to mine
and generate datasets from public university's websites and also ***National Council for
Higher Education (NCHE)***. These datasets will be used to train machine learning
algorithms that will be helping in prediction of the programs for the students.

# 3. Functionality
This tool will let students enter 7 grades scored on different subjects that includes the
best 6, and one interest making the model to have an array of 8 inputs and this model
will predict 6 outputs that will be best matching programs offered from different public
universities in Malawi based the input data. The tool could leverage best practices and
best AI/ML to develop needed insights to guide students.

# 4. Implementation and Algorithms Selection
This tool will use one of deep learning algorithm known as ***Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP)***.
Multilayer Perceptron are feed-forward artificial neural networks that generate outputs
from a set of inputs. In a Multilayer Perceptron, multiple layers of input nodes are
connected as a directed graph between the input and output layers. The Multilayer
Perceptron is a deep learning method that uses back-propagation to train the network.

# Why MLP?
Multilayer Perceptron is mostly used to solve complex problems stochastically, allowing
approximate solutions to challenging issues like fitness estimation. Using the perceptron
model, machines can learn weight coefficients that help them classify inputs. This linear
binary classifier is highly effective in arranging and categorizing input data into different
classes, allowing probability-based predictions and classifying items into multiple
categories. Multilayer Perceptron have the advantage of learning non-linear models and
the ability to train models in real-time.
